# weather-activity-suggester
A Python app that suggests fun activities based on local weather, using OpenWeatherMap and OpenAI APIs

## Overview
This application suggests fun activities to do based on the current weather in your city. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and the OpenAI GPT model to provide activity suggestions tailored to the weather conditions.

## Features
- Fetches real-time weather information for any city.
- Provides activity suggestions based on the current weather conditions and temperature.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language used for the application.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: To get the weather data for the specified city.
- **OpenAI API**: To generate activity suggestions based on the weather data.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-activity-suggestion-app.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd weather-activity-suggestion-app
   ```
3. **Install required packages**:
   The application requires `requests` and `openai` Python packages. Install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install requests openai
   ```

## Setup
1. **API Keys**:
   - Get your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
   - Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. **Configure API keys**:
   Replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` and `'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY'` in the script with your actual API keys.

## Usage
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python weather_activity_app.py
   ```
2. **Enter your city name** when prompted to get real-time weather data and activity suggestions.
